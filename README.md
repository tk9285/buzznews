# SEI-OWLS-P2
Project 2 for SEI-OWLS



# BuzzNews

Our assignment for Project 2 was to display 2 different sets of API's from a third party API and a mockAPI. We also had to use REACT to display API's on the webpage. The website I decided to create is called BuzzNews. I used a news API to display "TOP STORY NEWS" and a mockAPI to create a "SPORTS NEWS" sections display data that I created.

## Getting Started

To get started the user clicks on the deployment link which will bring them to the BuzzNew's landing page which will display the API's.

On the header of the page the user will see the hamburger icon which has a drop down menu that displays the 3 sections the user can select to bring them to that particular part of the website.

The main content section shows all the different types of services that BuzzNews offers to their users. The first part of the main section shows "TOP STORY NEWS" which displays the data from the Third Party API. The second section shows "SPORTS NEWS" which displays the data from the mock API. The third section is the "CREATE A POST" section which allows the user to create their own post which is added to the end of the data of the mock api and displayed in the "SPORTS NEWS" section.
